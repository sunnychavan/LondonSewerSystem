# LondonSewerSystem
A famous diver, McDiver, is going into the sewer system with the special glasses to seek a ring that someone dropped into the sewer. McDiver first puts on his special glasses to
locate and obtain the lost ring. He then takes off the special glasses and heads to the exit. But now, with the special glasses off, McDiver sees coins all over the sewer system, and on the way to the exit, McDiver picks up as many coins as possible. 

These mazes are randomely generated and Mcdiver has been programmed to first seek the ring in as few steps as possible and then escape to the exit while picking up as 
many coins as possible. 

# What I Learned
• To optimize iterative depth-first search using a second array that marks when a Node has been "discovered" but not visited 
• To treat a maze as a graph 
• Backtracking using try-catch statement 
• Utilizing shortest path algorithm to achieve max distance moved below a certain threshold (find a route that is as close but not exceeding a certain distance limit)
